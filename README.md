This program calculates the deformation of the car after colliding the wall. 
If the deformation is lethal (i.e it is greater than 180) then the car changes its color to red.
If the deformation is average (i.e it is greater than 80 and lesser than 180) then the car changes its color to yellow.
If the deformation is good (i.e it is lesser than 80) then the car changes its color to green.
